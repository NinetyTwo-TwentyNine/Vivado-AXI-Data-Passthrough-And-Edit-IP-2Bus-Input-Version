This is the 2-bus input version of my previous Vivado AXI data passthrough&edit IP project (https://github.com/NinetyTwo-TwentyNine/Vivado-AXI-Data-Passthrough-And-Edit-IP).
It does exactly the same things as the original IP, with the only difference of having a separate AXI bus for programming.
Refer to the original installation and usage insructions (https://github.com/NinetyTwo-TwentyNine/Vivado-AXI-Data-Passthrough-And-Edit-IP/tree/main/doc).
All of the changes related to installation and usage of this version of the IP are listed in the "doc" folder of this project (https://github.com/NinetyTwo-TwentyNine/Vivado-AXI-Data-Passthrough-And-Edit-IP-2Bus-Input-Version/tree/main/doc).
