This is the 2-bus input version of my previous Vivado AXI data passthrough&edit IP project (https://github.com/NinetyTwo-TwentyNine/Vivado-AXI-Data-Passthrough-And-Edit-IP).
It does exactly the same things as the original IP, with the only difference of having a separate AXI bus for programming.
Installation procedure as well as the instruction on how to use this IP are in the "doc" folder of this project.
